ELEC 49X - Capstone Project  

Full year team-based course to complete an engineering challenge, from ideation to realisation.  
Our chosen task was to design and build a prototype mobile robot for security and surveillance, complete with an android-based mobile user interface with broadcasted video feed. The robot was built using a Raspberry-Pi 5, mechanum wheels, and a custom-printed chassis. The UI app was developed in Android Studio. Due to the nature of the project, many files are protected from being shared publicly, but 1st-iteration 3D models are included as a sample of my work. The final version of these models can be seen in the final poster and report.
